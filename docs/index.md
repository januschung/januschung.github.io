### What I like

??? tip "Photography"
    :material-camera: 
    
    I used to take a lot of pictures with my Sony Alpha A900. During that period of time, people portrait and wedding documentary were my favorite. It was my honor to help two of my best friends and one of my primary school classmate to capture their big moments. I will upload some of my work in the coming future.
??? tip "Hi-Fi"
    :material-speaker::material-speaker: 
    
    The first time I listened to a real Hi-End Hi-Fi, I knew it my life would no longer be the same.  Thanks to my late Uncle 17 who brought me to the Hi-Fi world when I was 12. My current setup is DM602 S2 with a Mid range Yamaha AV Receiver.
??? tip "Reading"
    :fontawesome-solid-book-open: 
    
    Inspired by my secondary school class teacher, who told me his story about reading latest books from the bookstore when he could not afford it during his adolesencent age , I picked up reading as a hobby. My reading record is 54 books in a year.
??? tip "Woodworking"
    :material-hand-saw: 
    
    I built couple furnitures for my home with the skills I learned from secondary school D&T class, as well as from a summer job in a double deck bus repairing factory. Working with wood always gives me a peaceful feeling.
